2.  Implemented task prioritisation (e.g., high, medium, low). 
3.  Filtering and Sorting . 

### authentication flow in the provided code is a basic client-side implementation using React and local storage. It follows these steps:

1. **Registration:**
   - Users fill in the registration form with their username, email, password, and confirm password.
   - When they submit the registration form, the data is stored in the browser's local storage.

2. **Login:**
   - Users fill in the login form with their email and password.
   - Upon submitting the login form, the code checks if the user's email and password match the data stored in local storage.
   - If the credentials are correct, the user is considered logged in, and a session is established.

3. **Navigation:**
   - Once logged in, users can navigate to the to-do list and other pages.
   - The navigation bar is displayed with a "Logout" button, allowing users to log out and end their session.

### Additional security measures or considerations:

1. **Local Storage :**
   - Local storage is used to store user data.
2. **Password Matching:**
   - The code checks if the passwords entered during registration and login match.
   - Password matching is an essential security measure to ensure that users confirm their passwords accurately.

3. **Alert Messages:**
   - The code provides alert messages for users, such as successful registration, login, and errors in case of login failure.
   - These messages are for user feedback .

### Future Implementations
1. **Data Validation:**
2. **Security Concerns:**
3. **Session Management:**
4. **Server-Side Authentication:**
5. **Data Privacy:**
